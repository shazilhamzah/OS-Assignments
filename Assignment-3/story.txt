Once upon a time, in a beautiful tan castle, there lived an olive dragon named Draco. The castle was surrounded by lush green meadows. One day, Draco decided to explore the neighboring forest, where he encountered a mysterious white wizard. The wizard, wearing a flowing black robe, offered Draco a magical red potion. Draco hesitated but eventually decided to drink it. To his surprise, the potion transformed him into a majestic white phoenix. The once tan castle now sparkled with shades of red and green. As Draco soared through the sky with his new wings, he marveled at the olive trees and the vibrant red flowers below. The wizard explained that the transformation was a reward for Draco's bravery. From that day forward, Draco, the white phoenix, became the guardian of the enchanted forest. And so, the tale of Draco's adventures continued, with the colors tan, olive, and black playing significant roles in the magical world he now called home.
